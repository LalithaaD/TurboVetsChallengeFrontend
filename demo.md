## Backend Integration

To connect to a real NestJS backend:

1. Update `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   import { taskService, userService } from '../api/demoService';
   // To:
   import { taskService, userService } from '../api/taskService';
   ```

2. Ensure your NestJS backend is running on `http://localhost:3001`

3. The API endpoints should match the expected structure in `src/api/taskService.ts`

## Troubleshooting

- **Build errors**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **TypeScript errors**: Check that all types are properly imported
- **Styling issues**: Ensure TailwindCSS is properly configured
- **Drag & drop not working**: Check that React Beautiful DnD is properly installed

## Next Steps

1. **Customize**: Modify colors, layouts, or add new features
2. **Connect Backend**: Switch from demo service to real API calls
3. **Add Authentication**: Implement proper login/logout functionality
4. **Add Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets for live task updates
5. **Add Notifications**: Implement task due date notifications
